# Supplementary Specification

## Usability
- Must run on Android OS
- Use symbolic icons/images instead of language instead of internationalization
## Recoverability
- If game crashes at any time, restore progress from local save data
## Performance
- Maze generation should not make loading times longer than 10 seconds for smaller maze, up to 20 at larger mazes
- Timing between input and player movement should stay synced up with either consistent delay or instantaneous reaction
## Operational concerns
- Log all errors to persistent storage
